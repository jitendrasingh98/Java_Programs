Object Oriented Programming is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using classes and objects.
---->
Class:
->class is a user define data type which defines its properties and its functions.class is the only
  representation of the data.
->class does not occupy any memory space.

Object:
->Object is a run time entity.
->blue print of a class.
->When the object is created using new keyword, then space is allocated for the variable in a heap and the starting
address is a stored in the stack memory.

Constructor:
->Constructor is a special method which is invoked automatically at the time of object creation.
->It is used to initialize the data members of new object generally.
->Constructor have the same name as class.
->Does not have a return type(not even void).
->Constructor are only called once,at object creation.
---> 3 types of Constructor--->
1.Non-Parameterized Constructor:
->A Constructor which has no argument
->It is invoked at the time of creation an object.
->If we don't create one then its created by default by java.
2.P

Polymorphism :
->one name many form
two types of polymorphism ..
1.Compile Time Polymorphism -->function overloading
->Same function name with different return type or arguments.
example:
public void print(String name){sout(name);}
public void print(int age){sout(age);}

2.Run Time polymorphism -->function overriding

Inheritance:
