Multithreading is a process of executing multiple threads simultaneously.
Thread is a lightweight sub process, the smallest unit of processing.
Creating Thread:
     -> Using Runnable // Interface
     ->Using Thread // Class

Life Cycle of Thread:
                     New--(start)-->Runnable---->Running---[run() method exits or stop()]--->Terminated
                                      (Active State)--[sleep(),block() on I/O,wait()for lock,suspend(),wait()]-->Blocked-->Runnable

Thread Operations:
->Thread class provides methods to perform operations with threads.
->This thread class is present in java.lang package.So we don't need to import this package.

A Java process to running thread:
Main thread---->thread A----->thread B

Some important thread methods:
-> public string getName()-->Returns the name of the thread
->public void setName(String name)-->Set the name of thread
->public void run()-->contain the task of thread
->public ovid start()-->Start thread  by allocating resources
->public long getId()-->Returns the id of thread
->setPriority(p),getPriority()-->set and get priority
->sleep()
->join()
->interrupt()
->stop()
