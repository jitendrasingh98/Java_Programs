Java ArrayList class uses a dynamic array for storing the elements.
It is Like an array , but there is no size limit.
We can add and remove element anytime.
We can not create an ArrayList of the primitive types such as int, float, char etc.
It is required to use the required wrapper class.
Example:
         ArrayList<int> list = ArrayList<>(); //this is not work or wrong Syntax
         ArrayList<Integer> list ArrayList<>();//this is right syntax.
